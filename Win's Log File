I am trying to make this a log file to help me remember where
I was when I last worked in this project. I also want to leave
the items I expected to do next.

I have created a new project called "wbrinventory". I have CD'd
into the directory and have opened Sublime 2.

Then I deleted the first generate becuase I had included Tests from Rails.
I wanted to use Rspec. So I started over.
I changed the config file to generate the secure_token as Hartl says.
Then I configured respec

Then I pushed everything I have done to git. And then to GitHub. Then
I decided push up to Heroku. Because I have more than 5 apps they want a credit card. 
I sent a support request asking how to delete unused apps? Waiting 
answer.
Heroku answered telling me how to delete the un-used apps. I deleted most of them.
And then I asked about how I enter a Credit Card. Waiting for an answer.

I am struggling with the problem of whether to create a new Welcom controller as the place to key off to all the other apps. It seems that
this would be a good thing to do. Then I can have Inventory, Payroll, Invoices, etc.
I am currently working on Inventory. 
I think I DONOT want to creat a WELCOME. That will come later! I want to develope the INVENTORY first.
I am at 3.2 Our firt tests. Since this is where I am lacking I will spend 
more time here.
I am stopping today @3.2.1

11/2/2013 Worked my way through Rspec testing. I have a better understanding and have gotten Passes on everything up to Section 3.3.3

11/3/2013 Finished up to 3.4 Conclusion. Everything worked fine.
I commnitted all the work I had done and merged 'Static-pages' into
'master' branch. Next I need to do 3.5 and do the exercises.

11/11/2013 I am finally back to my app. I will have to adapt Hartl's sample app to mine. I just need to slowly be sure that I understand what he is doing so that I can do what I want to do. 
I want to simplify since what I am doing instead of making a home page I simply need to add all the links so that I can go from page to page. After I get the pages built I will modify how I do it.

CUT THIS FROM (display.html.erb) and replace it with what is in listing 5.2
<% provide(:title, "Display") %>

<h1>WBR Inventory</h1>
<p>
  This is the display page for the Inventory of
  Win Brisbin Rebuilder
</p>

I did this because Hartl w/o explanation of what he was doing changed what I had to what is currently in there. It has a dramatic effect on the Web Brower display.

11/17/2013
I need to start at Section 5.1.2 Bootstrap and Custom CSS. 
I will need to go slow and be sure that I grasp what Hartl is doing!

11/28/2013 I have been working on understanding CSS. I think I have some understanding. Now Hartl is going in to SCSS. I don't have to use it but I have to decide if I want to learn how to use SCSS.
BOOTSTRAP uses SCSS and I want to use BOOTSTRAP. So I suppose I need to understand the application of SCSS. I AM CURRENTLY IN SECTION 5.2.1 asset pipeline. 
I have read the material but I need to carefully go through the Rest of Chapter 5.

11/29/2013 I am now at 5.3 Layout Links

12/10/2013 I have finished with routes for Display, Lookup, and Edit in WBRInventory.
I am now going to going to create the Customer(Users) controller and create the def the new customer(user). I am tempted to use Users instead of Customers to make the entry simpler. But I am not going to do that.
